Statisticians have developed rigorous methods to evaluate this risk. Nevertheless, a part of subjectivity is always involved in the decision-making process. The theory is just a tool that helps making decisions in an uncertain world."

More precisely, we will show how to perform a **z-test**, and we will briefly explain the mathematical ideas underlying it. This kind of method (also called *frequentist method*), although widely used in science, is subject to many criticisms. We will show later a more modern approach based on Bayesian theory. It is very helpful to understand both approaches, because many studies and publications still follow frequentist methods."
